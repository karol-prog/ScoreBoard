I just try to iplement what I learned in JS course with Scrimba. 

I made a Score Board app for Basketball game.

I used a variables, functions and DOM JS for function this code. 
I had a little problem with creating a new game and reset the game score, but after googling and asking my friend for a help we got a solution with ES6 JS with template literals to join strings and numbers.

It was fun and quite challenging, but i make it work. :)

I know that this code or this game can be written easier way, but this is just beginnings.

See you in next mini project.
